# Changelog

All notable project changes are documented here. The project follows semantic
versioning once a stable `1.x` release is declared.

## [Unreleased]

- Institutional handover and authority transfer.
- Continued observability, availability, and mixed-load hardening.
- Refreshed dependency baselines and expanded auditing to frontend build tools.
- Published a reproducible summary of the August schema benchmark.
- Migrated React Router to v7 and removed the engine's unused NLTK dependency,
  clearing all Python and npm dependency-audit findings without exceptions.
- Pinned CPU-only PyTorch wheels by container architecture, avoiding unsupported
  CUDA packages on ARM production hosts and enforcing `pip check` in image builds.
- Made KB packaging, import, readiness, and job admission fail closed; completed
  the real deployment validation gates; and fixed authenticated browser downloads.
- Added a documented developer-to-production release process and a backup-first,
  exact-revision routine deployment command with automatic image rollback.

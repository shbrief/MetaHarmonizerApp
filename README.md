MetaHarmonizer is a human-in-the-loop platform for converting heterogeneous
clinical metadata into standardized, ontology-annotated, export-ready schemas.
It combines deterministic matching, curated aliases, semantic models, and an
optional LLM fallback with review workflows that keep curators in control.

**Public deployment:** [metaharmonizer.online](https://metaharmonizer.online)

**Project:** [cBioPortal GSoC 2026 proposal](https://github.com/cBioPortal/GSoC/issues/136)

## Capabilities

- Map source columns to cBioPortal, GDC, and curated target schemas.
- Normalize values against NCIt, UBERON, and EFO ontology snapshots.
- Review low-confidence mappings in risk-prioritized schema and ontology queues.
- Reuse personal curator decisions and promote reviewed decisions to a shared layer.
- Compare quality, confidence, stage, and coverage metrics before export.
- Export validated cBioPortal-compatible clinical metadata.
- Run asynchronous jobs with bounded retries, queue backpressure, and live progress.
- Preserve reproducibility through schema versions, ontology snapshot hashes, and audit history.

## Architecture

<a href="docs/architecture.md">
    <img src="docs/architecture-overview.svg" alt="MetaHarmonizer production architecture showing the curator request path, queued ML execution, durable state, engine boundary, external providers, and encrypted backups">
</a>

PostgreSQL is the durable source of truth. Redis holds reconstructable queue,
progress, rate-limit, and activity state. Long-running model execution is
bounded and queued, while curator review remains synchronous. The public
deployment stores study files, the versioned knowledge base, and model caches on
persistent host volumes; R2 stores encrypted PostgreSQL backups only.

The API and worker access the upstream
[MetaHarmonizer engine](https://github.com/shbrief/MetaHarmonizer) exclusively
through `backend/app/engine_adapter/`. CI enforces this boundary so application
code depends on a stable adapter protocol rather than upstream implementation
details. The current deployment is portable but not highly available because
the host, Caddy, PostgreSQL, Redis, API, and worker share one failure domain.

See the [detailed architecture](docs/architecture.md) for trust boundaries,
module ownership, consistency rules, deployment constraints, decision records,
and delegated scaling work.

## Technology

| Layer | Components |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query |
| API | FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy async, Alembic |
| Data | PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, arq |
| ML | MetaHarmonizer, Sentence Transformers, FAISS, optional Gemini |
| Operations | Docker Compose, Caddy, GitHub Actions, systemd adapters |

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Docker Engine with Compose, approximately 15 GB free disk, and
8 GB RAM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sehyunohlab/MetaHarmonizerApp.git
cd MetaHarmonizerApp
cp .env.example .env
```

For a local evaluation, set `AUTH_MODE=none` in `.env`. For JWT authentication,
replace `JWT_SECRET` with a random value of at least 32 bytes.

```bash
docker compose --profile kb run --rm kb-import
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The API health endpoint is
[http://localhost:8000/healthz](http://localhost:8000/healthz), and local Swagger
documentation is available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

The API container applies Alembic migrations during startup. See the
[local setup guide](SETUP.md) for authenticated development, native hot reload,
email configuration, reset procedures, and troubleshooting.

## Development and Testing

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# End-to-end tests against a running stack
cd e2e
npm ci
npm test
```

Protected CI validates backend and frontend tests, coverage floors, dependency
audits, secret scanning, CodeQL, container vulnerability scans, SBOM generation,
non-root execution, and runtime smoke tests. The
[engine adapter contract](.github/workflows/engine-boundary.yml) prevents direct
upstream-engine imports outside the adapter boundary.

## Security and Data Handling

MetaHarmonizer is intended for de-identified metadata. Do not upload protected
health information, direct identifiers, secrets, or credentials. Production
deployments should use HTTPS, strong host-only secrets, restricted registration,
encrypted off-host backups, and named operators. Security reports that may
contain sensitive information should not be posted to public issues.

Operational defaults and deployment controls are documented in
[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) and [production operations](docs/production-operations.md).

Vulnerabilities should be reported through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Product
support boundaries are documented in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

# Self-hosting MetaHarmonizerApp

A provider-neutral runbook to stand up a production instance with Docker
Compose on any Linux VM or compatible container host. The stack is **Postgres +
Redis + API + arq worker + Caddy (serving the built SPA)**. Cloud-specific VM,
DNS, firewall, secret-manager, scheduler, and backup-storage setup stays outside
the application boundary.

All production commands below use both Compose files so the development override
is never loaded accidentally:

```bash
export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.prod.yml
```

## 1. Requirements

- **Docker** + **Docker Compose v2** on the host.
- **~8 GB RAM**, **2+ CPU cores**, **~15 GB disk** (models + KB + Postgres).
  The embedding models load into RAM and run on CPU — no GPU required.
- A domain name if you want HTTPS (Caddy issues certs automatically).

## 2. Get the code + configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sehyunohlab/MetaHarmonizerApp.git
cd MetaHarmonizerApp
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — at minimum set these for production:

| Variable                                  | Set to                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET`                              | a real 32+ byte secret: `python -c "import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`                       | a strong password                                                                     |
| `JOB_MODE`                                | `queue` (so the worker runs harmonizations)                                           |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`                   | your org's email domain(s), comma-separated                                           |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` / `APP_BASE_URL`           | your public URL (e.g. `https://harmonize.example.org`)                                |
| `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` | `1` (load models from the seeded cache)                                               |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`                          | for verification/reset email; without it, delivery is skipped without logging tokens  |

The container DSNs for Postgres/Redis are set by compose — you do **not** edit
`DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL` for the Docker path.

### Decide your exposure before going public

Three values decide who can use the instance and how much work one account can
create. The public demonstrator runs them wide open on purpose, so it can be
evaluated without an approval step. **An institutional deployment should not.**
All three are single environment values — no code change, no rebuild.

| Variable | Demonstrator | Set instead | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | `*` — any verified email auto-approved | your domains, comma-separated | everyone else needs administrator approval |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_ROWS` | `0` — no row ceiling | e.g. `2000` | bounds the cost of one job |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `50` | lower if your tables are small | rejected while still streaming |

Two further limits are compiled defaults, not environment values: three active
studies per account, and a global queue cap of 200. They bound accidental load.
They do not stop someone who can register more accounts, which is why
`ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` is the control that matters on a public instance.

Registration can also be closed later without editing files:

```bash
scripts/registration_mode.sh close --domains "example.org,partner.org"
scripts/registration_mode.sh status
```

### Using a managed database instead of the bundled Postgres

The bundled `postgres` service is convenient, not required. It shares the host's
fate, so a single-VM deployment has a recovery point only as recent as the last
backup. An institution with managed PostgreSQL — point-in-time recovery,
automated patching, failover — should use it.

Set `EXTERNAL_DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and add the override that leaves the
bundled `postgres` service out:

```bash
EXTERNAL_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@db.example.org:5432/metaharmonizer

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
               -f docker-compose.external-db.yml up -d
```

No file needs editing. The variable replaces the compose-generated DSN for the
API, worker, and seed services, and the override assigns `postgres` to a profile
that is never enabled so it does not start. Migrations still run on API startup,
so the target database only needs to exist and be reachable, with the role able
to create tables.

This path is exercised in CI: the `External Database Deployment` job boots the
stack against a separate database, asserts the bundled Postgres never starts,
checks that migrations created the schema, and logs in.

Everything else is unchanged: backups in section 9 apply to whichever database
is configured, though a managed service will have its own snapshot facility that
is usually preferable.

## 3. Obtain the published offline bundle

Normal deployments **do not build ontologies or embeddings**. The release URL
and SHA-256 in `.env.example` point at the prebuilt `kb-latest` asset. Keep those
values in `.env`; the importer downloads the bundle when no local copy exists
and rejects any checksum mismatch.

Building a new bundle is a maintainer operation that can take several hours on a
cold machine. Its exact prerequisite order is:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m scripts.build_kb
python -m scripts.warm_schema_cache
python -m scripts.package_kb -o ../kb/kb_offline_bundle.tar.gz
```

`package_kb` fails unless all three required ontology corpora, their FAISS
indexes and ID sidecars, the engine database, both embedding models, and the
warmed schema cache exist. Use `--allow-incomplete` only for an explicitly
development-only artifact. The maintained quarterly build, resumable checkpoint,
quality comparison, release upload, and checksum PR are documented in
`docs/kb-lifecycle.md`.

## 4. Seed the KB + models into the stack

```bash
docker compose --profile kb run --rm kb-import
```

This installs the KB, corpus CSVs, and models into the shared `engine_cache`,
`corpus_data`, and `hf_cache` volumes so the API/worker load everything from
disk. The command ends with `scripts.kb_probe` over every launch ontology and
fails if any required asset is absent. API readiness and upload admission repeat
the same completeness contract, so the first user task can never start an
on-demand ontology build.

## 5. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d              # postgres, redis, api, worker, caddy, web
docker compose ps                 # all should be healthy
docker compose exec api curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/healthz   # 200 when the API is up
docker compose exec api curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/readyz    # Postgres, Redis, KB all ready
```

Migrations run automatically on API start (`alembic upgrade head`).

## 6. Create the first admin

```bash
SEED_EMAIL=admin@example.org SEED_PASSWORD='ChangeMe!2026' \
  docker compose --profile seed run --rm seed
```

Log in at your domain (or `http://<host>` if no TLS), upload a CSV, and run a
harmonization to confirm the engine loads offline.

## 7. TLS / domain

Set `DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, `APP_BASE_URL=https://...`, and
`COOKIE_SECURE=true` in `.env`. `Caddyfile.prod` provisions and renews
certificates automatically. Point the chosen DNS provider's A/AAAA records at
the host and allow inbound TCP 80/443.

## 8. Operations

- **Backups:** use the encrypted R2 backup tooling in Section 9. A volume
  snapshot alone is not an off-host backup.
- **Labeled-data export:** the worker writes a nightly confirmed-mapping corpus
  to `backend/data/exports/labeled/`; pull it live from `GET /api/v1/export/labeled`.
- **Logs:** `docker compose logs -f api worker`. Set `SENTRY_DSN` for error tracking.
- **Application upgrades:** deploy an exact merged revision with the
  backup-first, preflighted command below; merging a pull request does not
  automatically change production.
- **Scale throughput:** `docker compose up -d --scale worker=N`.

### Automatic KB rollout

After the hosted KB refresh passes its superset and accuracy gates, it publishes
`kb_offline_bundle.tar.gz` and `kb_offline_bundle.sha256` to `kb-latest`.
Production can poll that release hourly without storing an SSH key in GitHub:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/metaharmonizer-kb-update.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now metaharmonizer-kb-update.timer
systemctl list-timers metaharmonizer-kb-update.timer
```

The updater downloads and verifies the published checksum, seeds SHA-specific
staging volumes, runs an offline KB probe, switches API/worker to those volumes,
waits for health, verifies the current ontology snapshot SHA, and restores the
previous volumes automatically if validation fails. It keeps two successful KB
volume sets by default.

Check without downloading/importing the bundle:

```bash
KB_DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/deploy_kb_bundle.sh
```

Run immediately instead of waiting for the timer:

```bash
sudo systemctl start metaharmonizer-kb-update.service
journalctl -u metaharmonizer-kb-update.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

### Production checks and growth reports

Install the five-minute health/threshold check and daily capacity report:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/metaharmonizer-ops-* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now metaharmonizer-ops-check.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now metaharmonizer-ops-report.timer
```

Reports are written under
`~/.local/state/metaharmonizer/operations/`. Alert delivery and authenticated
5xx monitoring use the host-only configuration described in
`docs/production-operations.md`; the timers remain useful without provider
credentials and explicitly report unconfigured delivery/backup dependencies.

### Application release

For routine code or dependency releases, use the exact-revision deployment
command rather than an ad hoc `git pull`/Compose sequence. Before its first use,
record the independently verified live revision once without changing that
checkout:

```bash
git fetch --all --tags --prune
LIVE=<known-currently-deployed-40-character-commit>
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$LIVE"
git show origin/main:scripts/deploy_revision.sh > /tmp/deploy_revision.sh
chmod 700 /tmp/deploy_revision.sh
DEPLOY_BASE_URL=https://harmonize.example.org \
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT="$PWD" \
  /tmp/deploy_revision.sh --record-current "$LIVE"
rm /tmp/deploy_revision.sh
git show origin/main:deploy/systemd/metaharmonizer-kb-update.service \
  > /tmp/metaharmonizer-kb-update.service
sudo install -m 0644 /tmp/metaharmonizer-kb-update.service /etc/systemd/system/
rm /tmp/metaharmonizer-kb-update.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then use the protected `main` head:

```bash
git fetch --all --tags --prune
TARGET=$(git rev-parse origin/main)
DEPLOY_TOOL="$HOME/.local/state/metaharmonizer/deploy/bin/deploy_revision.sh"
DEPLOY_BASE_URL=https://harmonize.example.org \
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT="$PWD" \
DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1 \
  "$DEPLOY_TOOL" "$TARGET"
DEPLOY_BASE_URL=https://harmonize.example.org \
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT="$PWD" \
  "$DEPLOY_TOOL" "$TARGET"
```

It verifies durable live commit/image/database state, shares a lock with the KB
updater, verifies the encrypted backup, stops application services before
changing tracked runtime inputs, builds revision-labeled images, rejects
unreviewed schema changes, preflights dependencies and the engine, runs the
authenticated production audit, and restores the previous checkout and images
after a command failure or termination signal. The developer, reviewer, and
operator responsibilities and the special procedures for migrations,
configuration, KB updates, and rollback are in
[`docs/release-process.md`](docs/release-process.md).

### Application rollback

Use an exact tested Git revision, not a moving branch name. The rollback command
uses the same state-aware, backup-first engine as a forward release. The
immediately previous release uses its retained exact image IDs; other targets
must support revision-labeled builds. It republishes the SPA, recreates
API/worker/Caddy, runs the production audit, and updates the deployment record.
If validation fails, it restores the revision that was running when the command
started.

```bash
git fetch --all --tags --prune
DEPLOY_TOOL="$HOME/.local/state/metaharmonizer/deploy/bin/deploy_revision.sh"
DEPLOY_BASE_URL=https://harmonize.example.org \
DEPLOY_REPO_ROOT="$PWD" \
DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1 \
  "$DEPLOY_TOOL" --rollback <previous-tested-commit>
```

Run once with `DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1` to verify the target and live migration are
compatible without switching revisions. Remove it to execute the rollback.

Rollback never downgrades PostgreSQL automatically. It proceeds only when the
target revision contains the live Alembic head. If the target predates the live
schema, the command aborts before changing source or containers. For that case:

1. Create and verify an encrypted backup.
2. Review every intervening migration downgrade for data loss.
3. Stop application writes.
4. Run the explicit Alembic downgrade from the newer source revision.
5. Run the application rollback and repeat health, login, and critical workflow checks.

Additive schema changes may be backward-compatible, but the presence check is
deliberately stricter: rollback evidence must establish compatibility rather
than infer it. Never use `git reset --hard`, delete persistent volumes, or
restore a production database merely to roll back application code.

## 9. Encrypted PostgreSQL backups to S3-compatible storage

Backups use a dedicated S3-compatible bucket and credentials, separate from
application object storage. Cloudflare R2 is the current target, but AWS S3,
MinIO, and compatible institutional storage use the same endpoint/bucket/key
interface. Dumps are encrypted on the host with AES-256-GCM before upload. The
default retention policy keeps the newest 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 12 monthly
restore points.

Generate the host-only encryption key once:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/metaharmonizer
docker compose run --rm \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/metaharmonizer:/keys" \
  api python -m scripts.backup_postgres keygen --key-file /keys/backup.key
chmod 600 ~/.config/metaharmonizer/backup.key
sudo chown 1000:1000 ~/.config/metaharmonizer/backup.key
```

The application image runs as UID/GID 1000. The final ownership is required so
the non-root one-shot backup container can read the mode-0600 key. Never loosen
the key to group/world-readable permissions.

Put `BACKUP_R2_ENDPOINT`, `BACKUP_R2_BUCKET`,
`BACKUP_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `BACKUP_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the production
`.env`. Run and verify one backup manually before enabling the timer:

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  -v "$HOME/.config/metaharmonizer/backup.key:/run/secrets/metaharmonizer-backup.key:ro" \
  api python -m scripts.backup_postgres backup
```

Schedule the same one-shot backup command with the host's scheduler only after
the manual backup and clean restore drill succeed. The repository provides an
optional systemd adapter for Linux VMs; adjust `User`, `WorkingDirectory`, and
the key-file host path before installation:

```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/metaharmonizer-backup.* /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now metaharmonizer-backup.timer
systemctl list-timers metaharmonizer-backup.timer
```

Restore into a newly created, non-production database first:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres createdb -U "$POSTGRES_USER" metaharmonizer_restore_test
docker compose run --rm \
  -v "$HOME/.config/metaharmonizer/backup.key:/run/secrets/metaharmonizer-backup.key:ro" \
  api python -m scripts.backup_postgres restore \
    --target-database-url "postgresql+asyncpg://mh:<password>@postgres:5432/metaharmonizer_restore_test"
```

Then point a temporary API container at that database and run `/healthz` plus
the production audit. Never use `--allow-production` during a restore drill.

For Kubernetes, Nomad, or a managed scheduler, run the same Compose/API command
as a scheduled job and mount the encryption key from that platform's secret
store. The backup format and restore CLI are platform-independent.

## 10. cBioPortal validation gate

Before loading a study into cBioPortal, the export runs the LinkML vocabulary
gate. To also run cBioPortal's own `validateData.py`, point the integration test
at it: `CBIO_VALIDATE_DATA=/path/to/validateData.py pytest backend/tests/integration/test_validate_data_gate.py`.
